  <h2 class="subTitle">On to the picnic...</h2> 

  <p>Through the woods, Alice was attracted by a burst of noise. A long table was placed in the center of the open space, full of teapots, teacups, and snack plates, and there was no gap. Mr. Mad Hatter and March Rabbit were happily passing the teacups to each other, while the dormouse was taking a nap in the sugar jar."There is no place! There are no seats!" The March rabbit shouted like this, but together with the Mad Hatter, he moved the chair next to him out of an empty seat. As soon as Alice sat down, the chair moved by itself, and she had to hold the table quickly.Everything here is unreasonable—they painted their pocket watches with butter and danced on the table with teacups. Time seems to stay at six o'clock in the afternoon forever, and the tea party will never end. At first, Alice was at a loss for words by the chaos, but watching them seriously fool around, she finally couldn't help laughing. Although it was crazy and chaotic here, she could feel that no one really wanted to hurt her. It's much safer to sit here and have an inexplicable cup of tea than to meet the legendary Queen of Hearts, who is grumpy and will cut people's heads at any time. Alice took up the full teacup and thought to herself: this may be the only benefit of falling into the rabbit hole. In this crazy dream, she can at least choose to sit down and have a cup of tea at ease.</p>
