<h2 class="subTitle">Vist the Queen...</h2> 

<p>The Queen of Hearts' croquet ground resembled a vividly painted oil canvas. The Queen herself moved like a blazing flame, bellowing ever-changing rules with a thunderous voice. Each time she frowned, the soldier playing cards trembled in fear, the air seemed to freeze, and everyone waited in dread for the inevitable command—“Off with her head!” Amidst the chaos, Alice was inexplicably accused of stealing the fruit tart and thrust onto the dock. Witnesses—the Mad Hatter and the Cook—spouted incoherent nonsense, while the Queen's questions were illogical, like wildly flailed daggers. Overwhelming pressure surged from all sides, nearly suffocating her.
Just as the suffocating clamor reached its peak, a thought flashed through Alice's mind like lightning: This whole thing was absurd, like a dream that had gone on far too long.
She closed her eyes and stopped arguing. The Queen's roars and the crowd's clamor—all the sounds receded like the tide, slowly, slowly fading away.</p>
