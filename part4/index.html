  <p>After shrinking, Alice passed through the small door and entered a quiet forest. At the fork in the path, the famous Cheshire Cat lay sprawled on a low-hanging branch, grinning at her with an inscrutable smile. “Here,” the Cat said in a drawling tone, “everyone is mad. Go left, and you'll find the Mad Hatter and the March Hare at their never-ending tea party; go right, and you'll reach the Queen of Hearts' garden for a most peculiar game of croquet.” As soon as the words left its mouth, the cat began to fade, gradually dissolving into thin air until only that sly grin remained suspended in midair, pointing to two completely different fantasy paths for the hesitant Alice.</p>
